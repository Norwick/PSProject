# Recipe Rodeo Readme
Recipe Rodeo is a project I made for Per Scholas. It is a simple recipe website that allows users to create, tag, share, and search for recipes.  
By the way, if you’re trying to run the project, you will need to create a new application.properties instead of just changing values. You can find where to put it by looking at the .gitignore path.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
- I wanted to add avatars and recipe pictures. I was able to get file upload to work, but it was in the wrong location and I wasn’t able to upload it to the correct location. Since I didn’t have time, I decided to go with using emoji in place of pictures for the recipes and using gravatar for avatars, which had the added benefit of not needing an extra database field (and if you tilt your head sideways, it could be counted as a microservice). I think if I had more time, I would look into uploading the pictures directly to the database as blobs.
- Related to avatars, adding transparency and non-transparent text to overlay an image really gave me a headache. I ended up going with ‘background-image’ and then ‘linear-gradient’ on a button and then setting the button text to what I wanted, but then the background image repeated, so I had to look that up too. Thankfully other people have dealt with this exact same issue on stack overflow.
- Tomcat gave me a headache when I tried to manually set it up, so I ended up going with the automatically set up tomcat that spring starter projects configure for you.
- JUnit became sort of unusable for repository testing once I populated things. If it had really mattered, I think I could have just switched the database to a fresh one in properties, or backed up the data, or idk, got counts from before populating data and then after and deleted by id instead of ‘delete everything once done’.
- JUnit suites didn’t work for me and I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. I’m assuming there’s some dependency issue despite me trying a bunch of configurations and even giving in and including JUnit 4 on the build path, but I did four different tutorials and even generated a test suite via Eclipse and all of them ran but didn’t run the tests. I’m sure with enough time I’d be able to fix it, but I’m stumped, so I’m just including a fake suite class that doesn’t run. Sorry.
- Data entry so I could test looks was a huge pain. I think I created 40ish recipes (title only thankfully) so I could test the index/search page. It was also an issue because I spent time lovingly making recipes for the sake of getting recipe looks semi decent an only to find that it wasn’t properly saved and I was back to zero since my code isn’t robust enough to save javascript generated variable size input forms. I’m sure there’s a way, but since I can solve it by just not having bugs in my code, it’s fine for the scope of this project.
- I really wanted to store passwords as char arrays so I could blank them out, but I wasn't quite sure how to go about that with Spring involved. It was hard to google the question, so maybe it's not too relevant security-wise.
- Responsive design. I was trying to get bootstrap to work, but it was taking a long time, so I decided to not deal with it since it isn't an explicit requirement on the final project. I was trying to figure out how to calculate actual width via javascript so I could send it to the server and decide a suitable number of recipes in pagination, but it didn't calculate correctly, so I dropped that since it took too much time, since the only (but most important) broken thing on mobile is the nav-bar. I have an idea how to fix this if I revisit this: I'd look in depth into css media queries.
- Overall I would say there is too much spaghetti code in this project. It’s not apparent with the JPA side of things, but once you enter the general controller or look at the javascript for recipe editing and profile editing you’ll realize how brittle I made everything and how much I should have split things up into separate files. It’s fine for now, but if I came back to this that would probably the first thing to refactor. Also, sorry for the lazy javadoc comments.
